# metalsmith-sectioned-blog-pagination - Development Context

This file gives Claude operational context for working in this plugin. Plugin
behavior is documented in [README.md](README.md) and the architecture
rationale in [docs/THEORY.md](docs/THEORY.md) — don't duplicate them here.

## Project Overview

Generates numbered blog landing pages (`/blog/`, `/blog/2/`, …) from one main
template built with a sectioned/modular page paradigm, and fills in a
`pagingParams` object on the section flagged `hasPagingParams: true`. Post
counts come from scanning `blogDirectory` or, when `collectionName` is set, from
a named `@metalsmith/collections` collection. Runs before Markdown/Permalinks/
Layouts. Logic is split across `src/utils/` (validation, clone, update).

ESM-only Metalsmith plugin, published directly from `src/` (no build step),
targeting Node.js 22+. CommonJS consumers can still load it via Node 22's ESM
interop. It has **no runtime dependencies**; `@metalsmith/collections` is a test
devDependency (fixtures build real collections).

## MCP Server Integration (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT**: This plugin was created with `metalsmith-plugin-mcp-server`.
When working on this plugin, AI assistants (Claude) MUST use the MCP server
tools rather than improvising equivalents.

### Essential MCP Commands

```bash
list-templates                          # See what's available
get-template plugin/CLAUDE.md           # Retrieve exact template content
get-template configs/biome.json
get-template configs/release-it.json
validate .                              # Plugin validation + recommendations
diff-template .                         # Drift check vs current scaffold
configs .                               # Generate config files
update-deps .                           # Dependency update
```

### CRITICAL RULES for AI Assistants

1. **Use MCP server templates verbatim** — never paraphrase or "simplify"
2. **Run `list-templates` before guessing** at template names
3. **When `validate` produces a recommendation, copy it exactly** — including
   the exact command suggested
4. **Ask the user** before modifying `.release-it.json`, `package.json`,
   `biome.json`, or any other `.json` / `.yml` / `.config.js` file
5. **Never set `npm.publish` to `true`** in `.release-it.json` — releases
   here are deliberately manual

## Plugin Development Rules

### Use Metalsmith's native methods

Prefer the methods Metalsmith provides on the instance over external
packages:

```javascript
// ❌                                    // ✅
require('debug')('')                     metalsmith.debug('')
require('minimatch')(file, pattern)      metalsmith.match(pattern, file)
process.env.NODE_ENV                     metalsmith.env('NODE_ENV')
path.join(dir, file)                     metalsmith.path(file)
```

### Never mock Metalsmith in tests

Use a real `Metalsmith` instance. Metalsmith is in `devDependencies` for
exactly this reason. Mocking `metalsmith()`, `metalsmith.match`,
`metalsmith.debug`, `metalsmith.env`, `metalsmith.path`, or plugin invocation
has repeatedly hidden integration bugs. The tests here build real Metalsmith
instances and use the real `@metalsmith/collections` plugin to set up fixtures.

Mocking unrelated systems (network, non-Metalsmith fs concerns) is fine.

### Metalsmith goes in devDependencies, never peerDependencies

The plugin code itself never imports Metalsmith — it receives the instance
as a parameter. Tests import Metalsmith directly. Users have their own
Metalsmith install in their project.

## Pre-commit workflow

Before any commit or release, run in order:

```bash
npm run lint       # Biome: lint + format with autofix
npm run format     # Format only
npm test           # node:test runner against src/
```

If any step fails, fix the underlying issue and re-run. Don't skip hooks.

## Release commands

Only after the pre-commit workflow succeeds:

```bash
npm run release:patch   # Bug fix (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
npm run release:minor   # New feature (1.2.3 → 1.3.0)
npm run release:major   # Breaking change (1.2.3 → 2.0.0)
```

Releases use `./scripts/release.sh` which retrieves the GitHub token from
`gh auth token` and calls release-it. npm publishing is intentionally
manual.

## Before releasing: re-read the user-facing docs

Before any `npm run release:*`, read the user-facing docs end-to-end and
update anything that's drifted from current behavior. Drift goes unnoticed
during code-focused work, then ships, then needs a follow-up patch release
purely for docs.

Files to audit:

- [README.md](README.md) — installation, usage examples, options, badges
- [docs/THEORY.md](docs/THEORY.md) — architecture and design rationale

Specific things to grep for: option names and defaults (`pagesPerPage`,
`blogDirectory`, `mainTemplate`, `collectionName`) that no longer match `src/`,
the five `pagingParams` keys, the license badge (this plugin is **MIT** — a
past README wrongly showed an ISC badge and Features text copied from another
plugin), code examples that import removed exports.

If the change being released doesn't affect any user-visible surface, say so
explicitly when reporting the audit — don't claim drift you didn't find. But
default to reading.

## File organization

```

## Tooling

- **Biome** for lint + format (single tool, single config: `biome.json`)
- **node:test** + `node:assert/strict` for testing
- **Native coverage** via `node --test --experimental-test-coverage`
- **Node >= 22** required

## When validation flags something

The MCP server's `validate` tool can return:

- `failed` — must-fix (license missing, wrong package shape)
- `warnings` — quality concern (low coverage, stub THEORY.md)
- `recommendations` — optional with exact command to run

Implement recommendations as written. The validator catches real maintainer
feedback patterns (marketing language, hardcoded values that should be
options, CJS examples in ESM-only plugins, performance anti-patterns,
English-only output strings). Run `validate .` and copy the suggested fixes.
